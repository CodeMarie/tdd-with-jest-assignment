# TDD with Jest: Assignment

## Brief

In the `src` folder, you will find two files:

- getAge.js - exports a `getAge()` function that accepts an argument for a year and returns the age.
- getAge.test.js - imports getAge method and has some 
prewritten test cases without expectations.

If you run `npm run test` you can see that all of the tests are passing, this is the default behaviour if there
are no expectations. Please read carefully the descripitions of the `it` blocks and implement expectations accordingly so that our getAge method would be tested.

- You don't need to change the implementation of getAge, 
just need to test it.
